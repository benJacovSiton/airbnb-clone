The Japanese symbol for beginner is "ÂàùÂøÉËÄÖ" (pronounced shoshinsha). In Japanese writing, it is commonly used to indicate that someone is a beginner or a novice in a particular activity or skill. The symbol consists of three kanji characters: Âàù (sho) means "first" or "beginning," ÂøÉ (shin) means "heart" or "mind," and ËÄÖ (sha) means "person" or "individual." Together, they form the word for "beginner" or "novice."*/
